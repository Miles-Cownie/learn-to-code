# THE PROJECT WHERE I LEARN TO CODE
This is a project where I am practicing my skills and learning how to code the different things from my course. It is quite a personal space where I can make mistakes and get things wrong safely.

## FEATURES
Separate pages - mostly the same but ever so slightly different

Navigation links - set up to allow movement between the pages settled in a nice neat bar.

Primary image - the focal point of the pages to show my picture setting skills!

Link to external site - incorperated into the image to reduce screen clutter.

## FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
Whatever my course next teaches me!

Also a form page asking for all the secret details.

## TESTING
TBT - To Be Tested!

## UNFIXED BUGS
The mosquitos on page three
